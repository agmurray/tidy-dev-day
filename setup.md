# Setup

## Size and setup

* 30 URM, 30 general addmision, 20 helpers feels good. 
* 1:3 helper:participant ratio was definitely spot on.

## Issue triage

* Every target issue needs to be labelled with the tidy-dev-day label.
  Can see current list at  <https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+label%3A%22tidy-dev-day+%3Anerd_face%3A%22>.

* Ideally need 1-2 issues for each participant.

* Weight towards documentation issues as they are generally simple wins and a good place to start for new contributors.

## Labels

* Each issue becomes a label (how?)

* Each label is stuck on a post-it: yellow = doc, red = bug, green = feature.

* Make some large labels to group related issues (e.g. ggplot2, r-lib) on the wall.

## Icebreaker

The file `bingo.pdf` with source `bingo.qmd` contains instructions for an icebreaker game to help get attendees chatting. To prepare:

* Print 80 copies of the `bingo.pdf` file.
* Purchase pens for those that don't happen to have one--50 should be enough.

When the "winner" alerts Simon (or whoever is hosting) that they've filled out the whole card, gather the attendees around the winner for a group photo.
